This repository contains the material or the final Project of the course "Getting and Cleaning Data" by Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (Coursera Platform).

The aim of this study is to handle raw data, clean it and return a well formatted and tidy data set. Specifically the original data dealt with wearable computing, a very exciting area in data science, and represented data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The target of the project was to generate four files as follows:

1. An independent **tidy data set** with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject, saved in a correct file.

2. A **R script** (**'run_analysis.R'**) performing all the cleaning, filtering and subsetting in order to return the data set at point 1.

3. A **CodeBook.md** file explaining in detail all the activities, including the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

4. A **README.md** file introducing the work.
